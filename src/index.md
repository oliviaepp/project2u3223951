## HOVERING FIGURE CONTOUR 556 / 2020

ABOUT THE WORK:
Hovering Figure is a Corten steel sculpture which was inspired by the extraordinary Wedge Tail eagles which hover over the rock escarpment on my property at Palmer in South Australia.  At this site a smaller version sits/floats on the edge of the actual rock escarpment, suspended between two large rocks. The larger version I will show in Canberra is 756 cm wide x 582 cm long. It can sit/hover at various heights above the ground, suspended by rocks at 3 points. The site will determine the height. There is also a textured pattern that runs across its entire surface reflective of the Australian landscape as seen from above. At the Contour 556 exhibition it should float both subtly and dramatically in the large open space there, mimicking the wedge tail eagles which glide across our broad blue skies, floating above our profoundly ancient and unique landscape.
